## Inspiration
We were inspired by the few and far between ways that a general citizen could share their experiences of being harmed by a company's wrongdoings. This spreads to multiple industries, including home energy, waste management, air travel, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and more. The most commonly-used way that citizens can voice their concerns is through the company's contact departments, and the wheels of those systems turn slowly. We strived to create a centralized platform to ensure that all voices, big or small, were heard. 

## What it does
Upvoice serves as a platform that allows individuals to share their grievances about a company's business practices without the frustration of ineffective communication methods. Instead of having a personal story/experience get lost in the noise, users directly appeal to stakeholders that can advocate for systematic changes and responsible business practices.

Our main goal is for citizens to have a voice to share their unique stories and perspectives, and also advocate for the change that they want to see in the world. As users post additional stories and insights, their future stories are more often into the forefront of our application's repository.
